# THM-Room-Checker

Python script to track the progress of a custom path for different Try Hack Me users


**Description**

Let's say your cybersecurity firm is considering acquiring THM Business Licenses for your analysts, but you need to perform a POC and simulate how would you keep track of custom curated paths meeting ad-hoc requirements.
This script is a demonstration for keeping track of the completion of those curated paths by inputting a try hack me username.

The script was based on Unofficial API documentation by gnarlito on Postman: https://www.postman.com/gnarlito/workspace/tryhackme-doc/documentation/18269560-6482e605-fc19-4dbd-bbcf-934aa81eec21
